### Genome assembly for two Aristidoideae species

We generated HiFi data for two Aristidoideae species, *Aristida adscensionis* and *Stipagrostis hirtigluma*, and assembled a draft genome for each of them. We first extracted the chloroplast and mytochondrial reads and attempted to assemble their genomes. Then, after filtering out the organelle reads, we assembled the nuclear genome and annotated and soft-masked repetitive elements. We checked the quality of the final assembly using Inspector and its completeness using BUSCO. Finally, we annotated the genomes using Helixer.
